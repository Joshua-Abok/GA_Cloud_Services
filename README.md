# GA_Cloud_Services

This repository contains a Python project for GA Cloud Services. The project is configured with a Makefile to streamline various development tasks such as installing dependencies, linting, and running tests. Additionally, it includes a GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration.

## Project Structure


- `__pycache__/`: Directory containing compiled Python files.
- `.github/workflows/main.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow configuration.
- `.coverage`: Coverage report file.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by git.
- `hello.py`: Main Python script.
- `Makefile`: Makefile containing commands for installing dependencies, linting, and testing.
- `README.md`: This README file.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.
- `test_hello.py`: Unit test for `hello.py`.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10.12
- `pip` (Python package installer)
- `make` (build automation tool)

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```sh
make install
````

## Linting

This command will run pylint with specific options to disable certain warnings and messages (R, C) for the hello.py file:

```sh
make lint
```

## Testing
This command will run pytest with verbose output and include a code coverage report for the hello.py file.
To run the tests with pytest and generate a coverage report, execute:

```sh
make test
```

## Continuous Integration
The project is configured with GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/main.yml` and is **triggered** on every push to the repository.

### Workflow Steps

#### Checkout the repository:

```bash 
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
```

#### Set up Python 3.10.12:
```bash 
- name: Set up Python 3.10.12
  uses: actions/setup-python@v1
  with:
    python-version: 3.10.12
```

#### Install dependencies:
```bash 
- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
    make install
```

#### Lint the code:
```bash 
- name: Lint
  run: |
    make lint
```

#### Run tests:
```bash 
- name: Test
  run: |
    make test
```
The workflow ensures that on every push, the code is checked out, the Python environment is set up, dependencies are installed, the code is linted, and the tests are executed.
